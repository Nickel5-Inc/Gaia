### Progress Log

#### Database Operation Improvements (2024-03-20)
- Updated ValidatorDatabaseManager to properly inherit timeout protections:
  - Removed redundant engine/session creation
  - Added timeout handling to connection management
  - Integrated with base class connection pool management
  - Enhanced retry logic with proper timeout checks
  - Improved error logging for connection issues

#### Resource Management Improvements (2024-03-20)
- Implemented chunking for large data operations:
  - Added chunked processing for soil moisture regions (5 regions per chunk)
  - Implemented chunked miner table updates (32 miners per chunk)
  - Added chunked score recalculation (10 UIDs per chunk)
  - Added explicit memory cleanup between chunks
  - Introduced small delays between chunks to prevent system overload
  - Added progress logging for chunk processing

#### Monitoring Improvements (2024-03-20)
- Enhanced watchdog implementation:
  - Moved watchdog to dedicated thread for independent monitoring
  - Added graceful startup and shutdown
  - Improved error isolation between watchdog and main tasks
  - Added thread-safe state management
  - Enhanced logging for thread lifecycle events

### Implementation Notes

#### Database Operation Implementation Notes
- Base timeout settings:
  - 30 seconds for queries
  - 180 seconds for transactions
  - 10 seconds for connection establishment
- Connection pool health monitoring:
  - Automatic reset after 3 consecutive failures
  - Health check before providing connections
  - ValidatorDatabaseManager inherits all timeout protections
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff for connection attempts
- Log entries to watch for:
  - "Timeout on connection attempt {N}" - indicates connection timeouts
  - "Failed to ensure pool exists" - indicates pool health issues
  - "Successfully reset database connection" - indicates pool reset
  - "Database connection verified" - indicates successful health check 

#### Resource Management Implementation Notes
- Chunking settings:
  - Soil regions: 5 regions per chunk with 1s delay
  - Miner updates: 32 miners per chunk with 0.1s delay
  - Score recalculation: 10 UIDs per chunk with 1s delay
- Memory management:
  - Explicit cleanup of large data objects
  - Forced garbage collection between chunks
  - Progress tracking for each chunk
- Log entries to watch for:
  - "Processing region {id} (chunk offset: {N})" - indicates region chunk processing
  - "Processed nodes {start} to {end}" - indicates miner update progress
  - "Processing score recalculation for UIDs {chunk}" - indicates score recalculation progress
  - Error messages for individual chunk failures 

#### Monitoring Implementation Notes
- Watchdog thread management:
  - Uses ThreadPoolExecutor with single dedicated thread
  - Independent event loop for async operations
  - Graceful shutdown with task cleanup
  - 60-second check interval
- Thread safety:
  - Atomic state transitions for watchdog status
  - Thread-safe task health updates
  - Isolated error handling per thread
- Log entries to watch for:
  - "Started watchdog in separate thread" - indicates successful watchdog startup
  - "Error in watchdog thread" - indicates thread-level issues
  - "Stopped watchdog thread" - indicates graceful shutdown
  - Existing timeout and health check messages
