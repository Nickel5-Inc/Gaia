## Progress Log

### Memory Optimization (2024-03-20)
- Implemented comprehensive memory optimization for soil task and scoring:
  - Soil Task:
    - Chunked region processing (5 regions per chunk)
    - Memory-efficient TIFF data handling with 1MB chunks
    - Explicit cleanup of large data objects
    - Memory usage tracking and logging
  - Scoring Mechanism:
    - Chunked prediction scoring (32 predictions per chunk)
    - Efficient numpy array handling with proper dtype
    - Memory threshold monitoring (1GB)
    - Automatic cleanup when threshold exceeded
    - Per-chunk memory tracking and garbage collection

### Implementation Notes

#### Memory Optimization Details
- Soil Task Memory Management:
  - Region processing in chunks of 5 with memory tracking
  - TIFF data processed in 1MB chunks for base64 encoding
  - Explicit cleanup after each region and chunk
  - Memory usage logged at start/end of processing

- Scoring Mechanism Memory Management:
  - Predictions processed in chunks of 32
  - Memory threshold set to 1GB with automatic cleanup
  - Efficient numpy array handling with float32 dtype
  - Intermediate array cleanup in RMSE calculation
  - Memory usage monitoring with cleanup triggers

#### Memory Usage Monitoring
- Key metrics tracked:
  - Initial memory usage per operation
  - Peak memory usage during processing
  - Memory change after each chunk
  - Cleanup triggers and thresholds
  - Resource usage warnings and alerts
