# Gaia Validator Configuration Template
# Rename this file to .env and fill in your specific values.

# --- Database Configuration ---
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=<YOUR_DB_PASSWORD> # Replace with your actual database password - default is configured to 'postgres'
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=validator_db
DB_TARGET=validator
DB_CONNECTION_TYPE=socket
ALEMBIC_AUTO_UPGRADE=True

# --- Application Environment ---
# Set to 'prod' for production or 'dev' for development (enables more verbose logging)
ENV=prod

# --- Subtensor/Blockchain Configuration ---
WALLET_NAME=default       # Your Bittensor wallet name
HOTKEY_NAME=default       # Your validator's hotkey name
NETUID=237                # Network UID (e.g., 237 for testnet, 57 for mainnet)
SUBTENSOR_NETWORK=test    # Bittensor network ('test' or 'finney')
SUBTENSOR_ADDRESS=wss://test.finney.opentensor.ai:443/ # Subtensor chain endpoint

# --- NASA Earthdata Credentials (Sensitive - DO NOT COMMIT ACTUAL VALUES TO PUBLIC REPOS) ---
# These are required for downloading data from NASA.
# Create an account at https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/
# Accept EULAs for: GESDISC Test Data Archive, OB.DAAC Data Access, Sentinel EULA
EARTHDATA_USERNAME=<YOUR_EARTHDATA_USERNAME>
EARTHDATA_PASSWORD=<YOUR_EARTHDATA_PASSWORD>
EARTHDATA_API_KEY=<YOUR_EARTHDATA_API_KEY>  # This refers to your Earthdata login credentials used by the application.

# --- Miner Score Sender (Optional) ---
# Set to "true" to enable sending miner scores to an external API (if applicable)
SCORE_SENDER_ON=False

# --- Database Synchronization System (Optional, highly recommended for multi-validator setups) ---
# Set this to "true" ONLY if this validator is the designated source for DB backups. (You're not)
# For replica validators that will restore from Azure, keep this as "False" or omit.
# IS_SOURCE_VALIDATOR_FOR_DB_SYNC=False # Example for a replica

# Interval in hours for backup (on source) or restore check (on replicas)
DB_SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS=1

# --- Azure Authentication for DB Sync (Choose ONE method and fill details) ---
# The database user (DB_USER/DB_PASS above) will be used for pg_dump/pg_restore.

# Method 1: SAS Token (Recommended)
# The Blob service endpoint for your storage account.
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL="https://devbettensorstore.blob.core.windows.net"
# The SAS token string (including the leading '?' if it has one).
# Ensure this token grants Read/List for replicas; Read/Write/List/Delete for the source,
# to the specified AZURE_BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME_DB_SYNC.
# If you need an access token, please reach out to the dev team with a signed message proving ownership of a validator key with minimum 10K alpha stake
AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN=<YOUR_AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN>

# Method 2: Connection String (Simpler, but generally less secure than SAS Token)
# If using SAS Token (Method 1), leave this commented out or blank.
# AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=<YOUR_AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING>

# Name of the Azure Blob container for storing database dumps.
AZURE_BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME_DB_SYNC=data/gaia

# --- Local Directories for DB Sync Operations ---
# Local temporary directory on the SOURCE validator for pg_dump before Azure upload.
DB_SYNC_BACKUP_DIR=/tmp/db_backups_gaia
# Local temporary directory on REPLICA validators for downloading dumps before pg_restore.
DB_SYNC_RESTORE_DIR=/tmp/db_restores_gaia

# --- Backup Retention (for Source Validator) ---
# Number of recent backups to keep in Azure. Older ones are pruned by the source.
