Weather Task Hardening Integration Guide
======================================

This file provides concrete integration steps to add the hardening system
to the existing weather task without breaking current functionality.

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:
1. Add state consistency manager
2. Integrate with existing recovery
3. Replace vulnerable patterns
4. Add monitoring & alerting

    1. Fail-safe: Always err on the side of safety and recovery
    2. Idempotent: All recovery actions can be safely repeated
    3. Auditable: All state changes are logged with reasoning
    4. Atomic: Critical state transitions happen atomically where possible

IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:

✅ Phase 1: Minimal Integration (IMPLEMENTED)
  ✅ Add WeatherTaskHardeningMixin to weather_task.py
  ✅ Replace recovery call with enhanced_recovery_check()
  ✅ Test with existing functionality

□ Phase 2: Enhanced Patterns (NEXT)  
  □ Replace scoring worker pattern with safe_day1_scoring_worker_wrapper()
  □ Add atomic transaction patterns
  □ Test thoroughly with scoring operations

□ Phase 3: Full State Manager (LATER - Higher Risk)
  □ Integrate complete WeatherStateConsistencyManager
  □ Add database schema for tracking tables
  □ Implement comprehensive validation queries

□ Phase 4: Monitoring & Alerting (RECOMMENDED)
  □ Add structured logging for monitoring systems
  □ Implement health metrics endpoint
  □ Set up alerts for critical inconsistencies

ROLLBACK PLAN:
- All changes are additive and can be feature-flagged
- Original patterns remain as fallbacks
- Can disable via config: auto_recovery_enabled = False
