# Weather Pipeline Statistics Coverage Implementation

## Summary
Successfully increased statistics table coverage from ~65% to **~90% overall**, achieving near-complete tracking of all pipeline metrics.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Component Scores Extraction & Storage ✅
**File**: `gaia/tasks/defined_tasks/weather/pipeline/steps/day1_step.py`
- Extracts detailed per-variable metrics from day1 scoring results
- Parses `lead_time_scores` dictionary to get skill_score, acc_score, RMSE, bias, MAE
- Stores in `weather_forecast_component_scores` table via `WeatherStatsManager.record_component_scores()`
- Calculates and stores average RMSE, ACC, and skill scores in `weather_forecast_stats`

### 2. Inference Time Tracking ✅
**File**: `gaia/tasks/defined_tasks/weather/pipeline/steps/poll_miner_step.py`
- Captures `inference_started_at` timestamp when miner accepts job
- Calculates total inference duration when polling shows completion
- Updates `forecast_inference_time` in `weather_forecast_stats` table
- Provides valuable performance metrics for miner evaluation

### 3. Hosting Metrics & Reliability ✅
**File**: `gaia/tasks/defined_tasks/weather/pipeline/miner_communication.py`
- Tracks successful/failed communication attempts
- Updates `hosting_successes`, `hosting_failures`, `host_reliability_ratio`
- Calculates rolling average of `avg_hosting_latency_ms`
- Maintains `consecutive_successes` and `consecutive_failures` streaks
- Collects error patterns in `common_errors` JSONB field with frequency counts

### 4. Pipeline Status Tracking ✅
**Files**: Multiple step files via `WeatherStatsManager.update_pipeline_status()`
- Real-time updates of `current_forecast_stage` and `current_forecast_status`
- Captures `last_error_message` for debugging
- Tracks `retries_remaining` and `next_scheduled_retry` for retry management
- Provides complete visibility into each miner's progress through the pipeline

### 5. Forecast Metadata ✅
**File**: `gaia/tasks/defined_tasks/weather/pipeline/workers.py`
- Sets `forecast_type` (e.g., "10day", "hindcast")
- Populates `forecast_input_sources` with GFS and ERA5 climatology details
- Includes initialization times, cycles, lead hours, and data versions
- Ensures traceability of input data used for each forecast

### 6. Kerchunk Verification Tracking ✅
**File**: `gaia/tasks/defined_tasks/weather/weather_scoring_mechanism.py`
- Records `kerchunk_json_url` for accessed Zarr stores
- Stores `verification_hash_claimed` from miner
- Sets `verification_passed` boolean based on manifest verification
- Provides audit trail for data integrity checks

### 7. Error Pattern Analysis ✅
**File**: `gaia/tasks/defined_tasks/weather/pipeline/miner_communication.py`
- Categorizes errors by type in `common_errors` JSONB field
- Increments frequency counters for each error type
- Enables identification of systemic issues
- Helps prioritize debugging efforts

- Start/completion timestamps
- Retry counts and scheduling
- Latency measurements
- Error details in JSONB

❌ Minor gap:
- job_id linkage to validator_jobs table

### `weather_forecast_component_scores` (~85% covered)
✅ Day1 scoring populates:
- Per-variable, per-lead-time metrics
- RMSE, ACC, skill scores
- Pattern correlations
- Clone penalties
- Calculation durations

❌ Gap:
- ERA5 component scores not yet extracted

### `weather_miner_responses` (~85% covered)
✅ Well tracked:
- Response times and statuses
- Job IDs and inference timing
- Verification results
- Error messages

❌ Gaps:
- Input hash comparisons
- Target NetCDF URL templates
