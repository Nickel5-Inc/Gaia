These are just super lazy docs to document what i did to get fiber running. docs arent awesome...

Install requirements.txt , I dont have versioning in yet

Register two wallets on the netuid 237 of test network. This next step is required for both validators and miners

Post IP to chain- fiber-post-ip --netuid <NETUID> --external_ip <YOUR_IP> --external_port <YOUR_PORT> --wallet.name NAME --wallet.hotkey HOTKEY

For miner, need to create a .env file with these details in the home directory:
wallet_name = os.getenv("WALLET_NAME", "default")
    hotkey_name = os.getenv("HOTKEY_NAME", "default")
    netuid = os.getenv("NETUID")
    subtensor_network = os.getenv("SUBTENSOR_NETWORK")
    subtensor_address = os.getenv("SUBTENSOR_ADDRESS")
    load_old_nodes = bool(os.getenv("LOAD_OLD_NODES", True))
    min_stake_threshold = int(os.getenv("MIN_STAKE_THRESHOLD", 1_000))


For validator, need a file called dev.env with the following:
WALLET_NAME=gaiatest
WALLET_HOTKEY=default


Run the miner in a pm2 instance or tmux session

Run the validator. I created the handshake method (with GPT) and would love for one of you to look over it. The miner and validator properly transmit data. The validator is not in a loop.
