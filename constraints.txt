# Pip constraints file to prevent problematic packages
# Use with: uv pip install -c constraints.txt -r requirements.txt (or pip if uv unavailable)

# CRITICAL: Prevent asyncio package installation
# The asyncio v3.4.3 package causes multiprocessing failures due to syntax conflicts
# with Python 3.7+ where 'async' became a reserved keyword.
# Always use Python's built-in asyncio module instead.
# 
# Note: pip constraints cannot directly forbid packages, but this documents the issue.
# The validator startup code will automatically detect and remove problematic asyncio installs.

# ERA5 NETCDF ENGINE FIX
# Simplified ERA5 API to use netcdf4 as primary engine for better reliability.
# Removed complex engine testing that was causing "unrecognized engine for to_netcdf" errors.
# The system now uses netcdf4 first, with simple fallbacks to h5netcdf and scipy.

# Additional problematic packages that might conflict with built-ins
# (Add more here as needed)

# AIOHTTP VERSION COMPATIBILITY FIX
# Pin aiohttp to a version that's compatible with fsspec
# aiohttp 3.11.x introduced a breaking change requiring 'history' parameter in ClientResponseError
# but fsspec doesn't provide this parameter yet, causing: 
# "ClientResponseError.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'history'"
aiohttp<3.11.0
