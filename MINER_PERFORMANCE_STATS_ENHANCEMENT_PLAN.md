# Miner Performance Stats Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary

The goal is to enhance the `miner_performance_stats` table to provide a complete trace of miner performance from individual task predictions through to final on-chain weights and incentives. This system should comprehensively track the entire scoring pipeline and provide transparency into how individual task performance contributes to final validator weights and chain consensus rewards.

## Current System Analysis

### üîç **Existing Data Flow Understanding**

1. **Task Score Generation**: Individual task scores are stored in `score_table` (weather, geomagnetic, soil_moisture_region_*)
2. **Weight Calculation Process**: 
   - Scores are aggregated in `_calc_task_weights()` ‚Üí `_perform_weight_calculations_sync()`
   - **Excellence Pathway**: Top 15% performers in any single task get maximum weight 
   - **Diversity Pathway**: Multi-task performers get scaled weights with bonuses
   - **Final Weight**: `max(excellence_weight, diversity_weight)` per miner
   - **Transformations Applied**: Sigmoid curves, rank-based fallbacks, normalization
3. **Chain Submission**: Final weights submitted via `FiberWeightSetter.set_weights()`
4. **Chain Consensus**: Bittensor network runs consensus to determine final `incentive` values
5. **Node Data Sync**: `handle_miner_deregistration_loop()` syncs chain data to `node_table`

### üìä **Current Table Schema Analysis**

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive task-specific metrics (weather, soil, geomagnetic)
- Performance trends and rankings
- JSON fields for detailed metrics storage
- Proper indexing and constraints

**Gaps:**
- No traceability from individual scores to final weights
- Missing pathway information (excellence vs diversity)
- No chain consensus data integration
- Redundant `id` field when `miner_uid` could be primary
- No intermediate calculation values stored

## Enhancement Strategy

### üéØ **Core Objectives**

1. **Complete Pipeline Traceability**: Track every step from task scores ‚Üí validator weights ‚Üí chain incentives
2. **Pathway Transparency**: Record which scoring pathway (excellence/diversity) was used
3. **Intermediate Value Storage**: Capture all calculation steps for debugging and analysis
4. **Chain Integration**: Include final consensus results and weight submission data
5. **Real-time Updates**: Sync with main scoring cycle to avoid duplicate work
6. **Automatic Cleanup**: Remove deregistered miner data automatically

### üóÇÔ∏è **Table Schema Modifications**

#### **Columns to Remove:**
- `id` - Use `miner_uid` as primary key instead

#### **Columns to Add:**

**Weight Calculation Pipeline:**
- `submitted_weight` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - Final weight submitted to chain by this validator
- `raw_calculated_weight` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - Pre-normalization weight from scoring algorithm
- `excellence_weight` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - Weight from excellence pathway calculation
- `diversity_weight` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - Weight from diversity pathway calculation
- `scoring_pathway` (VARCHAR(20)) - Which pathway was selected: 'excellence', 'diversity', 'none'
- `pathway_details` (JSONB) - Detailed breakdown of pathway calculation

**Chain Consensus Integration:**
- `incentive` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - Final incentive value from chain consensus
- `consensus_rank` (INTEGER) - Miner's rank based on final incentive values
- `weight_submission_block` (BIGINT) - Block number when weights were submitted
- `consensus_block` (BIGINT) - Block number when consensus was calculated

**Task Weight Contributions:**
- `weather_weight_contribution` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - How much weather scores contributed to final weight
- `geomagnetic_weight_contribution` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - How much geomagnetic scores contributed
- `soil_weight_contribution` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - How much soil scores contributed
- `multi_task_bonus` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - Bonus applied for multi-task participation

**Performance Analysis:**
- `percentile_rank_weather` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - Percentile rank in weather task (0-100)
- `percentile_rank_geomagnetic` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - Percentile rank in geomagnetic task (0-100)  
- `percentile_rank_soil` (DOUBLE PRECISION) - Percentile rank in soil task (0-100)
- `excellence_qualified_tasks` (TEXT[]) - Array of tasks where miner qualified for excellence pathway
- `validator_hotkey` (TEXT) - Which validator calculated these stats (for multi-validator environments)

#### **Modified Primary Key:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE miner_performance_stats DROP CONSTRAINT miner_performance_stats_pkey;
ALTER TABLE miner_performance_stats DROP COLUMN id;
ALTER TABLE miner_performance_stats ADD PRIMARY KEY (miner_uid, period_start, period_end, period_type);
```

### üîß **Integration Points**

#### **1. Main Scoring Integration** (`validator.py`)
**Location**: `_perform_weight_calculations_sync()` and `_calc_task_weights()`

**Integration Strategy**:
- Capture weight calculation data during the existing sync process
- Extract pathway decisions, intermediate values, and final weights
- Store data before final weight submission to chain
- **No duplicate work** - piggyback on existing calculations

**Key Data Points to Capture**:
```python
# From _perform_weight_calculations_sync()
performance_data = {
    'raw_calculated_weight': weights_final[idx],
    'excellence_weight': excellence_weight,
    'diversity_weight': diversity_weight, 
    'scoring_pathway': pathway,
    'weather_weight_contribution': weather_contribution,
    'percentile_rank_weather': get_percentile_rank(w_s, 'weather'),
    'excellence_qualified_tasks': qualified_tasks,
    'pathway_details': detailed_breakdown_json
}
```

#### **2. Chain Data Integration** (`handle_miner_deregistration_loop()`)
**Location**: When syncing `node_table` with chain data

**Integration Strategy**:
- Update performance stats with latest `incentive` values from chain
- Record consensus block numbers and submission details
- Calculate consensus rankings based on final incentive values

#### **3. Deregistration Cleanup** 
**Location**: `handle_miner_deregistration_loop()` - already implemented!

**Current Implementation**: The deregistration loop already calls:
```python
# Step 2.1: Performance stats cleanup for hotkey changes
await self.performance_calculator.cleanup_specific_miner(uid, old_hotkey)

# Step 2.5: Bulk cleanup for deregistered miners  
await self.performance_calculator.cleanup_deregistered_miners()
```

### üßπ **Cleanup & Maintenance**

**Automatic Deregistration Handling** (Already Working!):
- `cleanup_specific_miner()` - for hotkey changes
- `cleanup_deregistered_miners()` - for bulk cleanup  
- Triggered automatically in deregistration loop

**Performance Monitoring**:
- Track table size and query performance
- Monitor main scoring loop impact
- Alert on calculation failures or data gaps

### üéõÔ∏è **Configuration Options**

```python
PERFORMANCE_STATS_CONFIG = {
    'enable_detailed_pathways': True,          # Capture pathway decisions
    'enable_chain_integration': True,          # Sync with chain consensus  
    'enable_realtime_updates': True,           # Update during scoring cycle
    'retention_days': 30,                      # How long to keep historical data
    'cleanup_frequency_hours': 4,              # How often to cleanup deregistered miners
    'performance_impact_threshold': 0.1        # Max allowed scoring loop slowdown (seconds)
}
```

### üìä **Expected Benefits**

1. **Complete Transparency**: Full visibility into scoring pipeline from start to finish
2. **Debug Capabilities**: Ability to trace any miner's performance calculation steps  
3. **Analytics Power**: Rich data for identifying scoring patterns and validator behavior
4. **Automated Maintenance**: Self-cleaning system that handles miner lifecycle changes
5. **Multi-Validator Support**: Ready for environments with multiple validators

### ‚ö° **Performance Considerations**

- **Minimal Impact**: Piggyback on existing calculations, no duplicate work
- **Efficient Storage**: Use JSONB for complex data, proper indexing
- **Batch Operations**: Group database updates to minimize overhead
- **Memory Management**: Clean up calculation artifacts promptly

### üîê **Risk Mitigation**

- **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful handling of missing fields during migration
- **Failure Isolation**: Performance stats failures won't impact main scoring  
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and constraint checking
- **Rollback Plan**: Database migration can be reversed if issues arise
